#' Giraffe Affiliation
#' @description  The authors studied a herd of six female captive giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) for two years. They were concerned with the question of whether giraffe associated randomly or patterned their behavior and proximity in a manner indicative of social relationships. Affiliative interaction, proximity, and nearest neighbors for female giraffe living in a large outdoor enclosure were analyzed, and all three measures were nonrandomly distributed, indicating female giraffe had social preferences. Furthermore, preferences were consistent across measures and time, suggesting that adult female giraffe maintain relationships.
#' @details The three different relations (affil, proximity and neighbor) are given in the relation edge attribute.

#' Innovations among Physicians
#' @description This data set was prepared by Ron Burt. He dug out the 1966 data collected by Coleman, Katz and Menzel on medical innovation. They had collected data from physicians in four towns in Illinois, Peoria, Bloomington, Quincy and Galesburg.
#'
#'They were concerned with the impact of network ties on the physicians' adoprion of a new drug, tetracycline. Three sociometric matrices were generated. One was based on the replies to a question, "When you need information or advice about questions of therapy where do you usually turn?" A second stemmed from the question "And who are the three or four physicians with whom you most often find yourself discussing cases or therapy in the course of an ordinary week -- last week for instance?" And the third was simply "Would you tell me the first names of your three friends whom you see most often socially?"
#'
#' In addition, records of prescriptions were reviewed and a great many other questions were asked. In the ATTRIBUTES data I have included 13 items: city of practice, recorded date of tetracycline adoption date, years in practice, meetings attended, journal subscriptions, free time activities, discussions, club memberships, friends, time in the community, patient load, physical proximity to other physicians and medical specialty.

#'
#'Two kinds of dominance ranks are included. One, ss, is the ratio of an animal's number of "successes" to its number of "involvements." The other, ps, is calculated by assigning an animal 2 points for each other animal it bests on more than 50\% of their contacts. One point is given for a tie and none for less than 50\% successes. Since, except for a juvenile male (M2), there were no cross-sex contests, males and females are ranked seperately, but M2 is ranked with the females.

#' Protein-Protein Interactions (probably yeast)
#' @description
#' One research area in biology in which centralities have been applied is protein-protein interaction. Interactions between proteins are common. They play an important part in every process involving living cells. Knowledge about how they interact can lead to better understanding of a great many diseases and it can help in the design of appropriate therapies.
#'
#' Often studies of protein-protein interaction generate huge data sets. In the letter in Nature that was mentioned above, Jeong, Mason, Barabasi and Oltvai (2001) examined a data matrix that contained interactions linking 2114 proteins contained in yeast. Earlier experimental work had demonstrated that some of the protein molecules in yeast were lethal; if they were removed the yeast would die. Removing others, however, had no such dramatic effect. So Jeong et al. examined the question of whether the structural properties of those proteins, in particular their degree centralities, could predict which proteins were lethal and which ones were not. Their results showed that proteins of high degree were far more likely to be lethal than those of lower degree.
#'
#' Subsequent articles (cited below) questioned these results. The argument was that gaps in the data called the whole analysis into question.

#' Florentine Families (Business)
#' @description Breiger & Pattison (1986), in their discussion of local role analysis, use a subset of data on the social relations among Renaissance Florentine families (person aggregates) collected by John Padgett from historical documents. The two relations are business ties (specifically, recorded financial ties such as loans, credits and joint partnerships) and marriage alliances.
#'
#' As Breiger & Pattison point out, the original data are symmetrically coded. This is acceptable perhaps for marital ties, but is unfortunate for the financial ties (which are almost certainly directed). To remedy this, the financial ties can be recoded as directed relations using some external measure of power - for instance, a measure of wealth. PADGW provides information on (1) each family's net wealth in 1427 (in thousands of lira); (2) the number of priorates (seats on the civic council) held between 1282- 1344; and (3) the total number of business or marriage ties in the total dataset of 116 families (see Breiger & Pattison (1986), p 239).
#'
#' Substantively, the data include families who were locked in a struggle for political control of the city of Florence in around 1430. Two factions were dominant in this struggle: one revolved around the infamous Medicis (9), the other around the powerful Strozzis (15).

#' @description In the 1990s Rick Rosenfeld and Norm White used police records to collect data on crime in St. Louis. They began with five homicides and recorded the names of all the individuals who had been involved as victims, suspects or witnesses. They then explored the files and recorded all the other crimes in which those same individuals appeared. This snowball process was continued until they had data on 557 crime events. Those events involved 870 participants of which: 569 appeared as victims 682 appeared as suspects 195 appeared as witnesses, and 41 were dual (they were recorded both as victims and suspects in the same crime. Their data appear, then, as an 870 by 557, individual by crime event matrix. Victims are coded as 1, suspects as 2, witnesses as 3 and duals as 4.

#' Monastery
#' @description  Sampson recorded the social interactions among a group of monks while resident as an experimenter on vision, and collected numerous sociometric rankings. During his stay, a political "crisis in the cloister" resulted in the expulsion of four monks (Nos. 2, 3, 17, and 18) and the voluntary departure of several others - most immediately, Nos. 1, 7, 14, 15, and 16. (In the end, only 5, 6, 9, and 11 remained).
#'
#' Most of the present data are retrospective, collected after the breakup occurred. They concern a period during which a new cohort entered the monastery near the end of the study but before the major conflict began. The exceptions are "liking" data gathered at three times: SAMPLK1 to SAMPLK3 - that reflect changes in group sentiment over time (SAMPLK3 was collected in the same wave as the data described below). Information about the senior monks was not included.
#'
#' Four relations are coded, with separate matrices for positive and negative ties on the relation. Each member ranked only his top three choices on that tie. The relations are esteem (SAMPES) and disesteem (SAMPDES), liking (SAMPLK) and disliking (SAMPDLK), positive influence (SAMPIN) and negative influence (SAMPNIN), praise (SAMPPR) and blame (SAMPNPR). In all rankings 3 indicates the highest or first choice and 1 the last choice. (Some subjects offered tied ranks for their top four choices).
#' @details the different relations are given in a list of networks in the same order as given in the description.

#' Taro Exchange
#' @description These data represent the relation of gift-giving (taro exchange) among 22 households in a Papuan village. Hage & Harary (1983) used them to illustrate a graph hamiltonian cycle. Schwimmer points out how these ties function to define the appropriate persons to mediate the act of asking for or receiving assistance among group members.

#' Macaque Dominance
#' @description records dominance relations (a directed tie from a to b means a dominates b) in a colony of 62 adult female Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata fuscata). They are known as the "Arashiyama B group." Records were made during the non-mating season, April to early October, 1976. Approach-retreat episodes involving food were recorded.
#'
#'In addition, the presence of six lineages was reported. The first 4 animals belong to a lineage, and the next 14 belong to another. The following 31 are in a third lineage, and the next 6 are in the fourth. The following 6 are the fifth lineage, and the remaining animal is unrelated to the others.

#' Residence Hall Friendship
#' @description Cynthia Webster collected friendship data among the 217 residents living at a residence hall located on the Australian National University campus. Residents were interviewed individually at the start of the second semester.
#'
#'First, they were asked to recall all of their friends who currently lived in the residence hall. They then were provided with a list of all residents and were asked to add anyone whom they also considered a friend, but had forgotten to include. From the complete list of friends, they were asked to indicate the strength of each friendship tie. Most specified three levels of friendship, "best friend," "close friend," and "friend." The data were combined to form a valued, actor-by-actor matrix of reported friendship relations.

#' INSNA Teacher Student
#' @description When Barry Wellman founded the International Network for Social Network Analysis (INSNA) in 1977, he sent a questionnaire to all the founding members. Included were questions on who taught each founder and who each founder taught. This data set is based on their responses.
